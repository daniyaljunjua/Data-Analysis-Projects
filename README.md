# Data Analysis Projects

Welcome to my **Data Analysis Projects** repository! This folder contains a collection of various data analysis projects that I have worked on and continue to explore. These projects showcase my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using a variety of tools and libraries.

## Tools & Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language for most of my projects.
  - Libraries: `Pandas`, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn`, `Scikit-learn`, `Statsmodels`, etc.
  
- **Power BI**: Used for creating interactive dashboards and visualizations from datasets.

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For performing data analysis and presenting results in a clear, organized format.

- **SQL**: Some projects involve extracting and manipulating data using SQL queries.

## About This Repository

This repository contains a variety of projects including, but not limited to:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Data visualization and exploratory analysis
- Predictive modeling and machine learning
- Data reporting and business intelligence (e.g., Power BI dashboards)

I enjoy working on projects that allow me to experiment with different datasets and learn new analytical techniques. The goal is to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with the latest trends in data science and analytics.
